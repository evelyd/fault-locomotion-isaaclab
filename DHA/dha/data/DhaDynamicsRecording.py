        This method constructs the action `a_t` and history of nex steps `a_t+1` of the Markov Process.
        The action is defined as a set of observations within a window of fps=`frames_per_action`.
        E.g.: Consider the action is defined by the observations [m=momentum, p=position] at `fps` consecutive frames.
            Then the action at time `t` is defined as `a_t = [m_f, m_f+1,..., m_f+fps, p_f, p_f+1, ..., p_f+fps]`.
            Where we use f to denote frame in time to make the distinction from the time index `t` of the Markov
            Process.
            Then, the next action is defined as `a_t+1 = [m_f+fps,..., m_fps+fps, p_f+fps, ..., p_f+fps+fps]`.

            sample (dict): Dictionary containing the observations of the system of shape [action_time, f].
            action_observations: Ordered list of observations names composing the action space.
